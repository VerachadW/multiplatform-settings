/**
 * A collection of storage-backed key-value data
 *
 * This class allows storage of values with the [Int], [Long], [String], [Float], [Double], or [Boolean] types, using a
 * [String] reference as a key. Values will be persisted across app launches.
 *
 * The specific persistence mechanism is defined using a platform-specific implementation, so certain behavior may vary
 * across platforms. In general, updates will be reflected immediately in-memory, but will be persisted to disk
 * asynchronously.
 *
 * Operator extensions are defined in order to simplify usage. In addition, property delegates are provided for cleaner
 * syntax and better type-safety when interacting with values stored in a `Settings` instance.
 *
 * This class can be instantiated via a platform-specific constructor or via a [Factory].
